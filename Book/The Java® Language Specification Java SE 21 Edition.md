# 4  Types, Values, and Variables 

## Overview

The types of the Java programming language are divided into two kinds: primitive
types and reference types. The primitive types (§4.2) are the boolean type and the
numeric types. The numeric types are the integral types byte, short, int, long, and
char, and the floating-point types float and double. The reference types (§4.3)
are class types, interface types, and array types. There is also a special null type. An
object (§4.3.1) is a dynamically created instance of a class type or a dynamically
created array. The values of a reference type are references to objects. All objects,
including arrays, support the methods of class Object (§4.3.2). String literals are
represented by String objects (§4.3.3).


There are four kinds of reference types: class types (§8.1), interface types (§9.1),
type variables (§4.4), and array types (§10.1).
