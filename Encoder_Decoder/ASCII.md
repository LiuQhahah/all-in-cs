# Overview

**ASCII** ([/ˈæskiː/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) [ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-us-ASCII.ogg) [*ASS-kee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key)),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 6  an acronym for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**, is a [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, [telecommunications equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_equipment), and other devices. Because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented, ASCII has just 128 [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point), of which only 95 are [printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters), which severely limited its scope. Modern computer systems have evolved to use [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), which has millions of code points, but the first 128 of these are the same as the ASCII set.

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority) (IANA) prefers the name **US-ASCII** for this character encoding.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-IANA_2007-2)

ASCII is one of the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE) milestones.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-4)

**Overview**

ASCII was developed in part from [telegraph code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_code). Its first commercial use was in the [Teletype Model 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33) and the Teletype Model 35 as a seven-[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) [teleprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter) code promoted by Bell data services.[[*when?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items)] Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) (now the [American National Standards Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute) or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Brandel_1999-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1963-6) underwent a major revision during 1967,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1967-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Jennings_2016-8) and experienced its most recent update during 1986.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1986-9) Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1986-9)

The use of ASCII format for Network Interchange was described in 1969.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-20_1968-10) That document was formally elevated to an Internet Standard in 2015.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-11)

Originally based on the (modern) [English alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet), ASCII encodes 128 specified [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart in this article.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-4949-12) Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable: these include the digits *0* to *9*, lowercase letters *a* to *z*, uppercase letters *A* to *Z*, and [punctuation symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_symbol). In addition, the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing [control codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_code) which originated with [Teletype models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Corporation#Teletype_Corporation); most of these are now obsolete,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Maini_2007-13) although a few are still commonly used, such as the [carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return), [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed), and [tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key#Tab_characters) codes.

For example, lowercase [*i*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I) would be represented in the ASCII encoding by [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) 1101001 = [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) 69 (*i* is the ninth letter) = [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) 105.

Despite being an American standard, ASCII does not have a code point for the [cent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)) (¢). It also does not support [English terms with diacritical marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_terms_with_diacritical_marks) such as [résumé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) and [jalapeño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalape%C3%B1o), or [proper nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_nouns) with diacritical marks such as [Beyoncé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9).

**History**

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now [INCITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INCITS)). The ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 211  and ultimately became the [American National Standards Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute) (ANSI).

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1963-6)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bukstein_1964-14) leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 66, 245  There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 435  The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to *sticks*[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-16)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-15) 6 and 7,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-CCITT_1963-17) and [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ISO_1963-18) The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-19) Locating the lowercase letters in *sticks*[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-16)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-15) 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [case-insensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-insensitive) character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [brace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_(punctuation)) and [vertical bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar) characters),[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-20) renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 247–248  ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1967-7)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Winter_2010-21) then USAS X3.4-1968,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1968-22) ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1986-9)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Salste_2016-23)


Codes 32-127 are common for all the different variations of the ASCII table, they are called printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols. You will find almost every character on your keyboard. Character 127 represents the command DEL.
